# PyCon Sweden 2017
## Telling stories with data

### About
This repository is linked to my talk at [PyCon Sweden](http://pycon.se/).

This is a project to use the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) library for a fast data exploration and visualisationi Python and a shareable web visualisation output. 

### Content
* The code related to the beginning of my talk is located in the `try_altair` notebook.

* The html file used for the [github page](https://eleonore9.github.io/pyconse17/) is `index.html` which is a copy of `test_chart3.html` (generated from the notebook).

Note: A more interactive version is `chart3_interactive` which is also linked on the github page via a button at the bottom of the page (but isn't generate from the notebook).

* The slides for my talk can be found in `slides-ele-pyconse17.odp` or `slides-ele-pyconse17.pdf`.

**Note:**

The example project at the end of my talk can be found in another [repository](https://github.com/Eleonore9/ebola_outbreaks).
