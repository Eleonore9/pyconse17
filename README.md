## PyCon Sweden 2017
### Telling stories with data

This repository is linked to my talk at [PyCon Sweden](http://pycon.se/).

The code related to the beginning of my talk is located in the `try_altair` notebook.

The html file used for the [github page](https://eleonore9.github.io/pyconse17/) is `index.html` which is a copy of `test_chart3.html` (generated from the notebook).
A more interactive version is `chart3_interactive` which is also linked on the github page via a button at the bottom of the page (but isn't generate from the notebook).


The slides for my talk can be found in `slides-ele-pyconse17.odp` or `slides-ele-pyconse17.pdf`.

The example project at the end of my talk can be found in another [repository](https://github.com/Eleonore9/ebola_outbreaks).
